## Intro

A collection of works to augment and enhance the laziness of our lives. 

Provided we won't be incredibly lazy about things, this will be the entire collection. Scrapped code, atrociously drawn architecture, color palettes, etc. etc. 

## Planned Projects

1. BetterTimeSheet > we're required to record time at our jobs. The system that's used is... not great. Really relies on you to keep an hourly track of everything. Which isn't great if you're coding because time and work can sometimes escape you since the system requires hard numbers. This will do time periods. For example: between TimeX and TimeY, I was in a ridiculously long meeting that accomplished nothing. The application will record that, log the time as "Meeting" and give you a total number of meeting hours within a day. 
2. BetterBudgeting > keeps track of how poorly we spend our money.
